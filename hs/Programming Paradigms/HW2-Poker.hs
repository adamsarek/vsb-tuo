   Homework 2: Poker (4)
   Task: Lets define a data types representing a deck of Poker cards.
         In poker, a player gets 5 cards into the hand.
		 Dealt hands are classified into several categories.
		 These categories are important to define who is the winner.
		 Rules for each category can be found here: https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker
		 Write a function decide that takes 5 dealt cards - Hand and returns a poker category in which it fits.
